# UROP2019-2020

This repository contains the resources for the 2019-2020 UROP Project Numerically Simulating New Exoplanet Systems.

For each student, there will be a folder with details about your assigned project. I wil provide a Jupyter notebook as a starting point for each of the later tasks (after you get the basics of coding down), and students should use GitHub to manage their progress (we'll learn how to do this when we first meet).

You will need to have python installed on your computer. I suggest using the Anacnoda distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), but if you already have a different one, that's fine too. You will also need to install several python packages, including the following: rebound, jupyter, matplotlib, numpy, pandas. We can go over how to do that, if you don't know how.
